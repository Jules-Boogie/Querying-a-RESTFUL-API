Iterative Development

For your project, you should use the following process:

Create the function stubs
Create the test stubs
Add tests for a function
Implement the function
Test until successful
Repeat steps 3-5 for the next function
The primary deliverable is a module with a collection of functions in it. The other deliverables are the testing script, which contains test cases for every function, and the application script, which is a simple user interface for someone who may not understand Python to be able to use your currency converter.

Every function in the module currency is going to have a test procedure in the testing script. They will all have the form test_ and the name of the function being tested.

Example:

def test_before_space():

Reminder: Be sure to indent the docstring or specification in every function stub.

Strings should use the functions in introcs instead of methods.
In addition, this project has the following style requirements:
Every function must have a complete specification.
Every module must start with a docstring with your name and date.
There must be two blank lines between any two function definitions.
Function bodies should be indented with 4 spaces.
No non-docstring line may be longer than 80 characters.
Lines inside of a docstring may be longer than 80 characters.
